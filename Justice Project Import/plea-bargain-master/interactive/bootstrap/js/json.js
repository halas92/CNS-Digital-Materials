    "slideText": "You are 15 years old. A 14-year-old girl invites you into her house, where you have sex. Afterward, she tells her mother you broke in and forced yourself on her. You are charged with abduction, breaking and entering and rape in juvenile court. Prosecutors tell you they will try you as an adult unless you plead guilty. As part of the deal, they will also drop the abduction charge. Your public defender encourages you to take it.",

    "trialText": "You chose to go to trial, but in 2007 Edgar Coker decided to take the plea deal. However, he says he did not know that meant he would have to register as a sex offender. The judge ordered him to do so for the rest of his life.",
    "consequences": " Just three months after his conviction, his alleged victim recanted her allegations, now saying that Coker never raped her. But the courts rejected several attempts to get his conviction overturned, and he completed his sentence. About seven years after his conviction, with the help of University of Virginia’s Innocence Project, Coker was exonerated and his name was removed from Virginia’s sex offender registry.",
    "fact": "Pleading guilty may result in a shorter prison sentence but can have other, lifelong consequences. Depending on the crime and defendant’s status, a conviction can lead to lifetime sex offender registration, deportation, loss of government benefits and employment restrictions."

   "consequences": "In May 2017, Branch was picked up on new gun charges, after Baltimore police said they found a gun and drugs in a car in which he was riding. Because this was a violation of his probation, an additional year was included in his sentence for the new crime. He was released to a halfway house in February 2018. Two months later, his original conviction was voided and the charges dismissed by the Baltimore state's attorney's office after the arresting police officer pled guilty to racketeering charges for stealing cash and drugs from suspects and falsifying overtime hours.

By the time of retrial, Henry had a job, was back with family, and settled; he took the deal. His brother Juan, however, refused to say he committed a crime he had not committed, and went to trial, where he was acquitted after evidence indicated that a police officer had framed the men.",

The City of Chicago appealed, and Juan Johnson settled the case for $16.4 million. The cases of several other men have been overturned based on evidence the police officer had engaged in misconduct.",

He received no compensation from the city or state.",
   "fact": "Defendants who have their convictions overturned and then either plead guilty or choose not to contest their guilt — entering a plea in which they deny guilt but agree there is evidence on which a jury could convict them — commonly give up their right to file a wrongful conviction lawsuit against the state.

In 2013, a commission set up to evaluate claims of police torture referred him to the courts for a new hearing, saying that his torture claims were credible. The special prosecutors on the case, however, have argued that several of Anderson’s cases do not deserve a new hearing, partially because Anderson pleaded guilty in those cases. Anderson’s lawyers are challenging this argument; meanwhile, Anderson is still in prison, having spent nearly 27 years there so far.",

   "consequences": "Marshall spent almost 2 years in prison. After the Georgia Innocence Project received a letter from him that said, “I plead guilty out of being scared,” the project obtained DNA testing on several items the robber had left behind, which Marshall pointed out the state had never tested. The testing excluded Marshall and isolated another man’s DNA. Marshall was released from prison, and all charges were dismissed.",
   "fact": "While many U.S. states allow defendants who plead guilty to seek post-conviction DNA testing, Ohio expressly prohibits such defendants from seeking later testing. In several states — including Pennsylvania and Kentucky — statutes and court decisions have left defendants who plead guilty with limited access to post-conviction DNA testing."

It took King two more years to get out of prison because a judge initially ruled that her guilty plea prevented her from having a new trial. King lost her home, her dog, and most of her possessions. Her cosmetology certificate expired while she was in prison. Unable to do physical work because of her amputated leg, she lives on disability payments and food stamps. King is pursuing a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Kentucky state police detective, alleging he framed her. A Louisville detective won a $450,000 settlement in a whistleblower lawsuit contending he was demoted after he brought the confession to light. ",
   "fact": "The U.S. Supreme Court has explicitly allowed plea bargaining since 1970, when it refused to overturn Robert M. Brady's plea of guilty to kidnapping, which he made after finding out he could be eligible to receive the death penalty if found guilty at trial. In a unanimous decision, the Court ruled that plea bargaining was acceptable as long as the guilty plea was not produced by \"by actual or threatened physical harm or by mental coercion overbearing the will of the defendant.\""

As the case is pending on the Supreme Court docket, prosecutors offer you a deal: Enter a plea to the reduced charge of manslaughter, in which you maintain your innocence but agree there is sufficient evidence to convict you, as well as plead guilty to two counts of attempted armed robbery.

   "consequences": "Toca’s Supreme Court case was withdrawn from the court docket after he took the deal. That year, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of another Louisiana juvenile lifer, resulting in a 2016 decision that applied the Court’s earlier ban on mandatory life sentences for juveniles retroactively, to inmates already serving those sentences. Outside prison, Toca, the victim’s family, and Innocence Project New Orleans continued to maintain he was not guilty, including of those crimes to which he ultimately pleaded. Toca now runs a landscaping business which he started with the help of donations. ",
   "fact": "After convictions are overturned, defendants often are given the option of maintaining their innocence but conceding that a jury could convict them — a result that often leaves prosecutors without responsibility for a wrongful conviction and leaves defendants without a full exoneration."

Swift received a sentence of 36 years, and Richardson and Saunders received sentences of 40 years.

   "consequences": "In 2011, newly tested DNA evidence from the rape and murder matched serial rapist and killer Johnny Douglas, rather than Thames, Swift, Saunders, or Richardson. Still, Cook County State’s Attorney prosecutors maintained that the DNA match did not disprove the guilt of the teenagers, whose DNA was not found in the victim. Thames, Swift, Saunders, and Richardson, who became known as the “Englewood Four,” finally had their convictions overturned by a judge in November 2011, and prosecutors dropped the charges in January 2012. By that time, Swift was out on parole, and Thames had completed his sentence; both had to register as sex offenders. The other two had served nearly two decades in prison. Later in 2012, all four received certificates of innocence. In December 2017, the four men settled a lawsuit against the city of Chicago for $31 million. ",
